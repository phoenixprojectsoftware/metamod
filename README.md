# Phoenix Metamod
 
 
**Phoenix Metamod** is based on the original version of [Metamod](http://metamod.org/) written by _Will Day_ for Half-Life 1 with some improvements from [Jussi Kivilinna](https://github.com/jkivilin). This version of **Metamod** allows users to submit mods and support for them will be added.


**Phoenix Metamod is incompatible with original `HLDS`. It's necessary to have installed [ReHLDS](https://github.com/dreamstalker/ReHLDS) (`API 3.1+`). There is no guarantee that the product will work in a different environment.**
